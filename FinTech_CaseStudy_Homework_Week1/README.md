## Overview and Origin

Juno Bank is a Neo-Bank founded by Alex Twigg, Chris Bayliss, David Hornery, Jacqui Colwell, Joseph Healy, Kate Keenan, Mal Hiscock and Tim Alexander founded Judo in 2015. Judo Bank was launched in 2018 and received it's unrestricted banking license in 2019. Joseph Healy is currently serving as the CEO

The idea of Judo Bank came to these group of founders when they saw flaws in the Australian lending system and ignorance towards lending to small to medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). They show the potential flaw in the bank lending system. So they decided to innovative and exceed the business banking standards

Up until Judo Bank's official IPO in Nov 2021. It had raise about $1.2 Billion in Capital and was valued at $1.9 Billion in June 2021. Judo bank had 5 funding rounds and multiply domestic and international investors in the business. Some Investors include UniSuper, Magnetar Capital, Myer Family Investments, Bain Capital Credit, the Abu Dhabi Capital group and Moore Strategic Ventures. 


## Business Activities:

One of the main problem faced by Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) is their inability to access to credit without putting a lending collateral. About 95% of all SMes loan are secure with lending collateral. Judo Bank has design and developed a cutting edge neobank bank who focus on providing the loan to the SMEs business.

According to a media release by Judo Bank in partnership with East & Partners. Surveying over 1750 SMes nation wide with turnover between $1 Million to $50 Million. The report states about 48.1% of DMEs applied for new funding. However, 27.7% of them were turned away by the big banks. Judo Bank wants to help these SMes to secure loan and secure growth in the future.

Judo Bank main target market is SMEs who are seeking Bank Loans, Line of Credit, Equipment Loan and Bank Guarantee. It offers loans from $250,000 onwards. THese lending solutions are specifically tailored for SMEs. Judo Bank also offers the Government SME Recover Loan Scheme. This scheme offers loans up to $5 Million Dollars to a business with turnover up to $250 Million Dollars who are affected by the Coronavirus Pandemic.

According to Jude Bank, every SME is unique, and they deserve a relationship with their bank that is based on an in-depth understanding of their business, professionalism, trust, and exceptional customer service, something that has been lacking in the banking industry for decades. Judo Bank's relationship-centric Model also provides a value proposition that the other big banks can't compete with.

Judo has been able to find help in Itoc to help them design and implement their Cloud base system. Judo Cloud base system is architect, Design and implement on Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It used a range of services off AWS cloud which include EC2, S3, RDS, API Gateway, Lambda and WorkSpaces. This technology will support real time effective distribution of information, transparent communication and decision making of the business. It will also help Judo Bankers and Brokers to provide customers the opportunity to gain insight and be transparent through the whole process. This will also lay the foundation for their next generation Cloud Native solution which will host their next generation products and services.


## Landscape:

Judo Bank exists in the Lending Domain predominantly focusing on providing business loans and also home loans.
 
Judo Bank taking the traditional lending system and putting a technological twist to improve efficiency shows the growing trend of end to end digitization. In the last few years more banks are moving towards online banking. We have also seen the rise of Neo-Banks such as :86400, Avenue Bank, Up and other such banks. It's because digitization makes it easy for the banks to streamline their operations such as customer information collection, organization, and analysis.
 
Artificial Intelligence is another major trend in the lending industry.This technology is being used by lenders to automate difficult processes. The majority of this is back-hand work. Fraud detection, credit scoring, and automated loan offer generation can all benefit from machine learning and artificial intelligence.
 
Loan monitoring is one area where AI has seen most progress. An AI programme might track macroeconomic trends and individual borrowers' finances, informing a lender if a loan is about to default. With that vital forewarning, lenders can contact out and work out a proactive plan with the company. On the other hand, AI technologies could encourage small firms to prepay their loans when they've had a particularly good month, increasing the likelihood of complete repayment and increasing customer loyalty.
 
So far there is only one other bank which is similar to Judo Bank in this domain. It's called Avenue Bank. Avenue bank was founded by entrepreneurs Dan Hurley and Colin Porter in 2018. It currently hasn't received their unrestricted license. However, have seen promising results in the initial funding rounds and utilizes Smart APIs, SAP clouds and also use a company called CreditorWatch as their primary technology.
 
However, All the major banks are also providing SMEs with loans. This includes ANZ, Commonwealth Bank, Macquarie Bank and such other banks. Other small loan specialists such as Propspa, OnDeck and other similar banks and company also offer loans.

## Recommendations

I would recommend that Judo Bank also start offering credit checking service within their cloud base system. It will be similar to something their competitor Avenue Bank is using their own Credit check called CreditorWatch and labelling it as their "serect sauce". 

As perviously mention, AI and ML is on the rise in this domain particularly in the loan monitoring function. The sofeware can help Perfomr a business credit check, moniitor cusotmers and receive real time alerts, Taks actions on debtors on high risk list and have a tool to make debt collection faster. 

Judo Bank is already running on AWS cloud and using many of it functions. Similar to CreditorWatch. It can utilise the Machine Learning algortims in Amazon EMR and use Amazon Kineses to collection real time data and finally use AWS Lambda to handle all the event without any manual intervention. Using applications and software provided within the AWS can be highly benefical for Judo Bank. 

Using AWS EMR can easily integrates with all the other AWS services to provide capabilities and functionality in terms of the networking, storage, security and so on. It will also be proven cost saving depending on the region the cluster is launch. THe price for Amazone EMR ranges between $1/ per hour to $0.11/ per hour.

Similarly, AWS Lambda provides the flexiblityy to run any third party languages, tools or frameworks. you can package any core and easily share them across multiple functions. It suports Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python and Ruby code. It can also help Judo to Connect to relational database, Automtic Scaling, Connect to hared file systems, Integrated security models and so forth

Finally, Amazon Kinesis is a cloud-based managed, scalable service that allows for real-time processing of enormous amounts of data per second. It will help Judo to built for real-time applications, and it will pull in any amount of data from multiple sources while scaling up and down on EC2 instances. It will also captures, stores, and processes data from big, dispersed streams like event logs and social media feeds. Kinesis delivers the data to various consumers at the same time after it has been processed.
